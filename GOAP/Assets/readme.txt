NEW GOALS AND ACTIONS

PATIENT

  The new goal for the patient is to check out at the newly added checkout counter before they leave the hospital.

  To complete this goal, the patient must perform the "Go To Checkout" action. After being treated, patients will walk from the treatment booths to the check out desk and wait for 1 second in order to "check out" before exiting the building instead of immediately leaving once they have been treated.


NURSE

  The new goal for the nurse is to report to the newly added head clinician, located in the bottom right room, once they have finished treating a patient.

  To complete this goal, the nurse must perform the "Report To Head Clinician" action. After finishing treating a patient, the nurse will walk to the office to the head clinicianâ€™s desk.

  After visiting the desk, the nurse will resume their duties.  Oftentimes, this is going to the staff room in the top right of the map, but in cases, the nurse will begin treating another patient.

================================================================

OTHER CHANGES

  Revised the hospital map to include an office for the head clinician in the bottom right of the building and a checkout counter on the left side of the arena by the entrance.

  Modified the range for when the spawner will spawn a new patient from [2,10] to [4,10].
